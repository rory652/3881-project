The aim of our project is to be able to track the spread of Covid-19 within a care home. To do this, we have split this project into 4 stages: Wearables: worn by the residents, featuring Bluetooth technology. Detection Modules: to detect the positions of the wearables. Uses Bluetooth 5.1 AoA (Angle of Arrival) and AoD (Angle of Departure). Back-end: Takes data from Detection Modules and processes it, detect contact between residents and make that accessible through a REST API. Front-end: App and Website allowing care home workers to see who needs to be tested and report cases Project Diagram graph LR W1[Wearable 1] W2[Wearable 2] W3[Wearable n] DM1[Detection Module 1] DM2[Detection Module 2] DM3[Detection Module n] BE[Back-end] FE[Front-end] W1 & W2 & W3 --> DM1 & DM2 & DM3 DM1 & DM2 & DM3 --> BE BE --> FE API Description This documentation focuses on the back-end REST API, containing detailed information on the various endpoints and how to access them.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about","text":"","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#project-description","text":"This is our Group Design Project for ELEC3885.
